#2.0.8
- **`_u8_flag` → `role` migration** — `group.py` v2 guild encoder writes `p['role']` but all 4 managers were setting `p['_u8_flag']`, causing silent data loss. Fixed in `guild_manager.py`, `func_manager.py`, `data_manager.py`, `character_transfer.py`
- **`character_transfer.py` — missing `role` on fallback player entry** — guild clone path could KeyError on v2 roundtrip when source player entry missing; added `'role': 1`
- **Updated `pst-binary-schemas` skill** — documents v2 guild tail (`_read_guild_tail_v2`), role semantics (1=admin, 2=submaster, 3=member), and all fixed files
- **Fixed cwd-dependent relative paths (system32 crash)** — all `base_path = '.'` and `'./saves'` hardcodes replaced with `get_base_dir()` from `resource_resolver`. 15 sites across 6 files: `import_libs.py`, `restore_map.py`, `dialogs.py`, `main.py`, `func_manager.py`, `save_manager.py`, `game_pass_save_fix.py`. Fixes `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied: 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\Backups'` when app runs elevated
- Bumped version to 2.0.8

#2.0.7
- **Per-item quantity cap** — non-stackable items (max_stack=1) stay limited to 1; all stackables uncapped to 999,999,999. Uses `max_stack` from generated game data
- **track user.cfg** — removed from `.gitignore`, now version-controlled
- **Abilities panel in Stats tab** — right side of Stats tab now shows relic abilities with toggles, icons, current values, and spinners. Supports edit and apply per player. Retranslates on language change
- **Translations: abilities keys** — added `inventory.abilities`, `inventory.abilities_apply`, `inventory.abilities_loaded`, `inventory.abilities_no_player_selected` in all 8 languages
- **NPC database expanded** — `update_npc_data()` now loads regular NPCs from `DT_PalCharacterIconDataTable.json` (not just boss NPCs). NPC count 33 → 369. Ammo Merchant and all trader/civilian variants now in DB
- **Sort no longer merges** — `_consolidate_container_slots` now just reorders by category/name. No stacking, no 9999 cap, gold and all items left untouched
- **Predator toggle** — paw icon button in pal editor info panel. Toggles `PREDATOR_` prefix. Filter toggle in Add New Pal and Bulk Pal Management dialogs. Red paw badge on thumbnail cards
- **Cheat mode** — bug icon toggle expands all caps to 255: level, IVs, souls, condenser rank, active skills (3→255), passive skills (4→255). Duplicate skills allowed, learnset bypassed. Skill pagination with mouse wheel scroll (3/page active, 4/page passive)
- **Max All Pals** — all 3 locations (pal editor, base inventory, menu→Functions) respect cheat mode caps. Double confirm dialog for menu version
- **Skill name fixes** — case-insensitive l10n lookup fixes "Thunder Rail" (was `Railbolt`). Partner skill names resolved from pal data
- **Add New Pal filter** — all filters removed: shows every entry in `_NAMEMAP`. Standard/Predator/Boss toggles all default to on
- Bumped version to 2.0.7
- **Bumped version to 2.0.7**

#2.0.6
- **Effigies now display in key items grid** — read from player `.sav` `RelicPossessNumMap` (bounty-token pattern)
- Edit/delete effigy count writes directly to `RelicPossessNumMap` (spendable at Statue of Power in-game)
- Add All Key Items prompts for effigy quantity per relic type
- Always show quantity badge on item/equip slots (count visible even at 1)
- XGP save picker (`pick_xgp_world`, `_load_xgp_save`) filters invalid saves via Level+LevelMeta+LocalData directory check
- Fixed `validate_xgp_save` `idx_path` resolution in `_load_xgp_save`
- `find_valid_saves` extracted as module-level function in `game_pass_save_fix.py`, reused in `restore_map.py`
- Theme/style consistency fixes for input dialogs
- Bumped version to `2.0.6`

#2.0.5
- `palsav` — fix `SetProperty` parsing + add missing type hint for `ValidatedStartPointIds`
- Pal editor — apply passive stat modifiers (MaxHP) to display and save writes
- Pal editor — scale current HP by passive multiplier for display consistency
- Breeding formula — align with palcalc: ceiling average for odd sums (`floor((A+B+1)/2)`)
